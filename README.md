## The nanoFramework Companion

This repository contains various libraries, tools and utilities with a permissive license to help you build systems and applications using the awesome [nanoFramework] (https://github.com/nanoframework) library.

**nanoFramework** is an implementation of the popular .NET Framework, but designed to work on constrained devices, like an STM32. With the sad demise of NETMF, arose a need to have an alternative so that .NET enthusiasts continue to build embedded systems using their favourite language - C#.
